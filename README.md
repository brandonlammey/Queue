# Queue

This generic templated queue data structure will create a queue object with a front and rear pointer. The pointers will point to and keep track of a dynamically allocated link of nodes and be able to perform basic queue operations: 

* Enqueue
* Dequeue
* PeekFront
* Check if empty

## Purpose

To provide a templated queue data structure to be used in any C++ program.  

## Configure

Remove Makefile and main.cpp
Add to personal code and Makefile 
Include with `#include "Queue.h"`


## Tests

#### **Currently working on adding test cases!**
